        <p>
            Mum, you are the light that guides me even in the darkest nights. Your love, care, and sacrifice have made me who I am today. You taught me to be kind, to be strong, and to always believe in myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your strength and resilience inspire me every day. You faced every challenge with a smile and showed me that every problem has a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your endless love and support. I am grateful for every moment we have shared and look forward to many more. You are my hero, my role model, my mum.
